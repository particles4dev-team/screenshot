Hey, you must have been doing 125 to keep up with me, good job. <br><br><br>\r\n16. I thought you had to be in relatively good physical shape to be a police officer. <br><br><br>\r\n15. I was going to be a cop, but I decided to finish high school instead. <br><br><br>\r\n14. Bad cop. <br><br>No donut. <br><br><br>\r\n13. You&apos;re not going to check the trunk, are you? <br><br><br>\r\n12. Gee, that gut sure doesn&apos;t inspire confidence. <br><br><br>\r\n11. Didn&apos;t I see you get your butt kicked on cops? <br><br><br>\r\n10. Is it true that people become cops because they are too dumb to work at McDonalds? <br><br><br>\r\n9. I pay your salary<br>\r\n8. So uh, you on the take or what? <br><br><br>\r\n7. Gee officer, that&apos;s terrific. <br><br>The last officer only gave me a warning. <br><br><br>\r\n6. Do you know why you pulled me over? <br><br> Okay, just so one of us does. <br><br><br>\r\n5. I was trying to keep up with traffic. <br><br>Yes, I know there is no other cars around, that&apos;s how far they are ahead of me. <br><br><br>\r\n4. What do you mean have I been drinking? <br><br> You are the trained specialist. <br><br><br>\r\n3. Well, when I reached down to pick up my bag of crack, my gun fell off of my lap and got lodged between the brake and the gas pedal, forcing me to speed out of control. <br><br><br>\r\n2. Hey, is that a 9mm? <br><br> That&apos;s nothing compared to this 44 magnum. <br><br><br>\r\n1. Hey, can you give me another one of those full cavity searches? <br><br>",

Once again, Johnny came to the rescue and stuck her again. &#x201D; Jesus Christ!&#x201D; shouted Mary. The teacher said, &#x201C;Very good!&#x201D; and Mary fell back to sleep. Then the teacher asked Mary a third question, &#x201C;What did Eve say to Adam after she had her twenty-third child?&#x201D; Again, Johnny jabbed her with the pin. This time Mary jumped up and shouted, &#x201C;If you stick that damn thing in me one more time, I&apos;ll break it in half!&#x201D; The Teacher fainted. <br><br>",

Eventually, they came upon a fairly large dog that was lying quietly on his side, licking his butt. He did not seem to notice as the men approached. &#x201D; This is the dog I had in mind for you,&#x201D; said the owner. The buyer was flabbergasted. &#x201C;You&apos;re joking!&#x201D; he exclaimed. &#x201C;This dog seems quite tame; he doesn&apos;t act at all like an attack dog at all. Hell, he&apos;s just lying there, licking his butt!&#x201D;<br><br>&#x201C;I know, I know,&#x201D; said the owner. &#x201D; But you see, he just ate a lawyer, and he&apos;s trying to get the taste out of his mouth. &#x201D;",

Joel giggled, sang &amp; talked out loud. Finally, his big sister had had enough. &#x201C;You&apos;re not supposed to talk out loud in church.&#x201D;<br><br>&#x201C;Why?  Who&apos;s going to stop me?&#x201D; Joel asked. Angie pointed to the back of the church &amp; said, &#x201C;See those two men standing by the door?  They&apos;re hushers. &#x201D; A mother was preparing pancakes for her sons, Kevin, 5, and Ryan, <br>\r\n3. The boys began to argue over who would get the first pancake. <br><br>Their mother saw the opportunity for a moral lesson. <br><br>&#x201C;If Jesus were sitting here, He would say &apos;Let my brother have the first pancake, I can wait&apos;&#x201D; . <br><br>Kevin turned to his younger brother &amp; said, &#x201C;Ryan, you be Jesus!&#x201D; A father was at the beach with his children when his four-year old son ran up to him, grabbed his hand, &amp; led him to the shore, where a seagull lay dead in the sand. &#x201D; Daddy, what happened to him?&#x201D; the son asked. <br><br>&#x201C;He died &amp; went to Heaven, &#x201D; the dad replied. The boy thought a moment &amp; then said, &#x201C;Did God throw him back down?&#x201D; A Sunday school class was studying the Ten Commandments. They were ready to discuss the last one. The teacher asked if anyone could tell her what it was. Susie raised her hand, stood tall, &amp; shouted, &#x201C;Thou shall not take the covers off thy neighbor&apos;s wife. &#x201D; At Sunday School they were teaching how God created everything, including human being s. Little Johnny, a child in the kindergarten class, seemed especially intent when they told him how Eve was created out of one of Adam&apos;s ribs. Later in the week his mother noticed him lying as though he was ill, &amp; asked, &#x201C;Johnny what is the matter?&#x201D; Little Johnny responded, &#x201C;I have a pain in my side. I think I&apos;m going to have a wife!&#x201D; This last one is out of the mouth of my co-workers 3-year old son Reese: &#x201C;Our father, who does art in heaven, Howard is his name.... &#x201D;",

Then, when I go downstairs I want to see a motherfuckin&apos; train going around the god damned tree, and when I go outside I want to see a red-assed fuckin&apos; bike leaning up against the damn garage!&#x201D; Christmas morning, Little Johnny woke up and rolled over into a big pile of dog shit. Confused, he walked downstairs and saw a bunch of dog shit around the Christmas tree. Scratching his head, he walked outside and saw a huge pile of dog shit by the garage. When he walked back inside with a curious look on his face. His dad smiled and asked... &#x201D; So Johnny, what did Santa bring you this year?&#x201D; Johnny replied, &#x201C;I think I got a fuckin&apos; dog but I can&apos;t find the son of a bitch. &#x201D;",

Believing the &#x201C;lie detector&#x201D; was working, the suspect confessed. When two service station attendants in Ionia, Michigan, refused to hand over the cash to an intoxicated robber, the man threatened to call the police. They still refused, so the robber called the police and was arrested. A Los Angeles man who later said he was &#x201C;tired of walking, &#x201D; stole a steamroller and led police on a 5 mph chase until an officer stepped aboard and brought the vehicle to a stop. <br><br>",

I mean, look at my fingers. They&apos;re a bloody mess. I can hardly hold on to this glass.&#x201D; The bartender looks at the guy&apos;s hands and says, &#x201C;Yeah, buddy, I can understand why you are so upset.&#x201D;<br><br>&#x201C;No, that wasn&apos;t what really got me so angry though.&#x201D; The bartender then asks in exasperation, &#x201C;Well, then, what did finally make you anger?&#x201D;<br><br>&#x201C;Well, I was hanging on the window, and I turned around and looked down I was only about six inches off the ground. &#x201D;",

I liked it so much, I got one for us too. &#x201C;No more was said about the statue, not even later that night when they went to sleep. Around two in the morning the husband got out of bed, went to the kitchen and returned a while later with a sandwich and a glass of milk. &#x201D; Here,&#x201D; he said to the &apos;statue&apos;, &#x201C;eat something. I stood like an idiot at the Smiths&apos; for three days and nobody offered me as much as a glass of water. &#x201D;",

They have nine lives or something. <br><br>This time sis jumped up and tried to kill the eel by sitting on it. <br><br>After about 35 minutes of struggle, they finally killed the eel. <br><br>I know it was dead this timebecause I saw sis&apos;s boyfriend peel off the skin and flush it down the toilet. <br><br>Mother fainted. <br><br>",

A bit embarrassed, the woman grinned and thanked the officer for pointing out her error. &#x201D; But before I let you go, Ma&apos;am, I have to ask... Is everyone in this car OK?  These women seem awfully shaken and they haven&apos;t muttered a single peep this whole time, &#x201D; the officer asks. &#x201D; Oh, they&apos;ll be all right in a minute officer.

        "body": "Unusual Case by William A. Morton, Jr, MDFrom &#x201C;Medical Aspects Of Human Sexuality&#x201D; July, 1991 p. 15 Scrotum Self-RepairOne morning, I was called to the emergency room by the head ER nurse. She directed me to a patient who had refused to describe his problem other than to say that he &#x201C;needed a doctor who took care of men&apos;s troubles.&#x201D; <br><br>The patient, about 40, was pale, febrile, and obviously uncomfortable, and had little to say as he gingerly opened his trousers to expose a bit of angry red skin and black-and-blue scrotal skin. <br><br>After I asked the nurse to leave us, the patient permitted me to remove his trousers, shorts, and two or three yards of foul-smelling stained gauze wrapped about his scrotum, which was swollen to twice the size of a grapefruit and extremely tender. <br><br>A jagged zig-zag laceration, oozing pus and blood, extended down the left scrotum. <br><br>Amid the matted hair, edematous skin, and various exudates, I saw some half-buried dark linear objects and asked the patient what they were. <br><br>Several days earlier, he replied, he had injured himself in the machine shop where he worked, and had closed the laceration with a heavy-duty stapling gun. <br><br>The dark objects were one-inch staples of the type used in putting up wallboard. <br><br>We X-rayed the patient&apos;s scrotum to locate the staples; admitted him to the hospital; and gave him tetanus antitoxin, broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy, and hexachlorophene sitz baths prior to surgery the next morning. <br><br>The procedure consisted of exploration and debridement of the left side of the scrotal pouch. <br><br>Eight rusty staples were retrieved, and the skin edges were trimmed and freshened. <br><br>The left testis had been avulsed and was missing. <br><br>The stump of the spermatic cord was recovered at the inguinal canal, debrided, and the vessels ligated properly, though not much of a hematoma was present. <br><br>Through-and-through Penrose drains were sutured loosely in site, and the skin was loosely closed. <br><br>Convalescence was uneventful, and before his release from the hospital less than a week later, the patient confided the rest of his story to me. <br><br>An unmarried loner, he usually didn&apos;t leave the machine shop during lunchtime with his co-workers. <br><br>Finding himself alone, he had begun the regular practice of masturbating by holding his penis against the canvas drive belt of a large floor-based piece of running machinery. <br><br>One day, as he approached orgasm, he lost his concentration and leaned too close to the belt. <br><br>When his scrotum suddenly became caught between the pulley-wheel and the drive-belt, he was thrown into the air and landed a few feet away. <br><br>Unaware that he had lost his left testis, and perhaps too stunned to feel much pain, he stapled the wound closed and resumed work. <br><br>I can only assume he abandoned this method of self gratification. <br><br>Note: William A. Morton is a retired urologist residing in West Chester, Pennsylvania. <br><br>",

Marriage is like a hot bath. <br><br>Once you get used to it, it&apos;s not so hot. <br><br>Marriage is like a mousetrap. <br><br>Those on the outside are trying to get in. <br><br>Those on the inside are trying to get out. <br><br>Marriage is like a violin. <br><br>After the music is over, you still have the strings. <br><br>Marriage is mind over matter; if the husband doesn&apos;t mind, it doesn&apos;t matter.. Marriage is not a word; it is a sentence. <br><br>Marriage is the high sea for which no compass has yet been invented. <br><br>Marriage is the mourning after the knot before. <br><br>Marriage is the only sport in which the trapped animal has to buy the license. <br><br>Marriage is the only war in which you sleep with the enemy. <br><br>Marriage is the process of finding out what kind of person your spouse would have really preferred. <br><br>Marriage is the triumph of imagination over intelligence. <br><br>Second marriage is the triumph of hope over experience. <br><br>Marriage is when a man and woman become as one; the trouble starts when they try to decide which one. <br><br>Marriage means commitment. <br><br>Of course, so does insanity. <br><br>Marriage still confers one very special privilege, only a married person can get divorced. <br><br>Marriages are made in heaven. <br><br>But so again, so are thunder and lightning. <br><br>A best man&apos;s speech should be like a mini-skirt; short enough to be interesting, but long enough to cover the bare essentials. <br><br>A chiseler is a man who goes stag to a wife-swapping party. <br><br>A gentleman is one who never swears at his wife while ladies are present. <br><br>A good husband is one who thinks almost as much of his wife as he does of himself. <br><br>A good woman is like a good bar... liquor in the front and poker in the rear. <br><br>A honeymoon should be like a table... four bare legs and no drawers. <br><br>A husband expects his wife to be perfect... and to understand why he&apos;s not. <br><br>",
